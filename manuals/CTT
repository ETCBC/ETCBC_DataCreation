NAME
     CTT - Coded Text Tabulated

DESCRIPTION
     The  CTT  file  is  a  human-readable   file   produced   by
     syn04types(1) concurrently with the PX(5) file.  It offers a
     summary of the clause atom hierarchy present  in  the  PX(5)
     file.   The information is displayed in nine fields of fixed
     width, which are the following.


          1   Verse Label
          2   Person/Number/Gender of the predicate
          3   Clause Atom Type of the daughter
          4   Indication of the mother
          5   Text Type
          6   Paragraph Number
          7   Clause Atom Number
          8   Tabulation and Subtypes
          9   Hierarchy made with the surface text from ct4.p(5)

     More about these fields can be  found  in  PX(5)  and  user-
     tab(5).

     Field 4, the indication of the mother, can be either:

     a)   the clause atom type of the mother, for example `WayX';
     b)   the marker [Q], which indicates that the mother  intro-
          duced direct speech;
     c)   the marker [R], which means that this atom is the  root
          of the clause atom hierarchy;
     d)   a   clause   constituent   relation,    for    instance
          `[adjunct]'.
