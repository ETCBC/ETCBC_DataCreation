DESCRIPTION
     An analysed text is one or  more  subsequent  language  sec-
     tions.   A language section consists of a language indicator
     followed by lines tagged with a verse  label.   Empty  lines
     and  lines  that  start  with  a pound sign (#) are ignored.
     Each line bears a tag, which consists  of  (an  abbreviation
     of) a book name and a verse index, for example `Ex 21,17'. A
     book name may start with a digit, if desired, (as in 3John).
     The tag is followed by white  space  and  the  text  of  the
     verse.  When a verse is to be distributed over more than one
     line, the tag is repeated on every line, for example:

     Words are separated by white space, where white space is  to
     be  understood  as any sequence of spaces and tabs. The dash
     is used to separate words which are  written  together  (for
     instance BJWM is rendered as follows: B-(H-JWM/).
