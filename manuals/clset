NAME
     clset - collection of accepted clause patterns

SYNTAX
     clause_set =             clause_pattern { clause_pattern }.

     clause_pattern =         phrase_pattern {  phrase_pattern  }
                              eocl <newline>.

     phrase_pattern =         phrase_type phrase_condition.

     phrase_condition =       empty_condition | condition_set

     empty_condition =        '-'.

     condition_set =          '(' condition  {  ','  condition  }
                              ')'.

     eocl =                   '99'.

     The  non-terminals  phrase_type  and  condition  are  signed
     integers.

DESCRIPTION
     The file clset contains the set of clause patterns  that  is
     used  by  syn04(1)  to build clause atoms.  A clause pattern
     consists of a string of phrase patterns that must be matched
     to  form  a  clause atom.  Each phrase pattern to be matched
     consists of a phrase type and possibly  additional  require-
     ments in the form of `morphological' and lexical conditions.

     If condition is a number smaller than 100, it refers to  the
     morphological  condition  in morfcondcl(5) identified by the
     same number.  If it is greater than 100, it  refers  to  the
     lexical  condition in lexcondcl(5) with line number equal to
     the offset from 100.  So condition 23 is morphological  con-
     dition  23 in morfcondcl(5) and condition 123 is the lexical
     condition found at line 23 of lexcondcl(5).

     The clause patterns in clset(5) are expected by syn04(1)  to
     be  in  descending  numerical  order, first on the string of
     phrase types (disregarding eocl), then on  condition_set  in
     ascending order.

NOTES
     In this description we have used `clauses' as a  short  hand
     for the more correct term `clause atoms'.
