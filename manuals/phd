NAME
     phd - transcript of phrase divisions  made  during  a  syn03
     session

SYNTAX
     file =              line { line }.

     line =              verse_label phrase { phrase } EOI  <new-
                         line>.

     verse_label =       <string of exactly eleven characters>.

     phrase =            word { ',' word } ':' phrase_type deter-
                         mination.

     EOI =               '999'.

     word =              state phrase_dependent_part_of_speech.

     In the above syntax the white space  has  been  omitted  for
     reasons  of  clarity.   The  identifiers not further defined
     (phrase_type,        determination,        state         and
     phrase_dependent_part_of_speech) are all signed integers.

DESCRIPTION
     In the phrase divisions file (with the extension `phd')  the
     decisions  are recorded that are made about the phrase divi-
     sions during a syn03(1) session.  For every verse  processed
     there  is  one  line  in the file that reflects the way this
     verse has been divided into phrases.  For every  word  in  a
     phrase state and phrase dependent part of speech are stored,
     as are for every phrase phrase type and determination.

NOTES
     In this description we have used `phrases' as a  short  hand
     for the more correct term `phrase atoms'.
