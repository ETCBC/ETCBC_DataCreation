DESCRIPTION
     Ps1 is the format of the morpho-syntactic data  base  output
     by  syn01(1).   This type of file contains the result of the
     first analysis at word level where morphemes and word  func-
     tions are being assigned a value.

     lexical data
          The lexical data at this stage are provisional and will
          be specified in further detail by syn02(1).  To be more
          precise:  lexeme is fully determined,  lexical  set  is
          given  the  default  value  of  0 (unknown) and part of
          speech is either -1 (others), 1 (verb), 2 (noun)  or  3
          (proper noun).

     morphological data
          The positive values  used  in  the  morphological  data
          block  are defined in the file morfset(5).  In addition
          to these values, 0 and -1 are used to denote absent and
          not applicable respectively.

     word functions

          verbal tense
               Verbal tense has one of the following values.  Not
               applicable   (-1),  imperfect  (1),  perfect  (2),
               imperative (3), infinitive construct (4),  infini-
               tive absolute (5), participle (6), wayyiqtol (11),
               weyiqtol (12) and passive participle (62).

          person
               Person has  one  of  the  following  values.   Not
               applicable  (-1),  unknown  (0), first (1), second
               (2) and third (3).

          number
               Number has  one  of  the  following  values.   Not
               applicable  (-1),  unknown (0), singular (1), dual
               (2) and plural (3).

          gender
               Gender has  one  of  the  following  values.   Not

               masculine (2).

          state
               State has one of the following values.  Not appli-
               cable  (-1),  unknown (0), construct (1), absolute
               (2) and emphatic (3).

     Apart from the first two fields the above  syntax  does  not
     impose a fixed width upon any of the fields. There are, how-
     ever, with respect to history and readability  customary  or
     preferred  widths.  In the traditional layout part of speech
     has a width of 3 positions, verbal tense a width of 4, state
     a  width  of  5 and all other fields have a width of 2 posi-
     tions.

NOTES
     The name PS file originally stems from the work on  Psalm  1
     in  the  early  days of the Werkgroep Informatica.  When the
     research shifted to phrases, the term was reassessed  as  to
     mean  `Phrase Structure' file.  Nowadays, however, this flag
     no longer covers its cargo as PS files are a data  base  for
     the complete morpho-syntactic analysis of a text.
