NAME
     ps3 - morpho-syntactic analysis at phrase level

SYNTAX
     The syntax of this file is an extension  to  the  syntax  of
     ps1(5), with the following supplementary rules.

     line =              label   <space>    lexical_data    space
                         morph_data    space    func_data   space
                         phrase_data <newline>.

     phrase_data =       phrdep_pos   space   phrase_type   space
                         phrase_det.

     phrdep_pos =        integer.

     phrase_type =       integer.

     phrase_det =        integer.

DESCRIPTION
     Ps3 is the format of the morpho-syntactic data  base  output
     by  syn03(1).   This type of file contains the result of the
     analysis at phrase level,  where  the  phrase  features  are
     being  assigned  a  value.   The  phrase features are phrase
     dependent part of speech, phrase type and phrase  determina-
     tion.

     phrase dependent part of speech
          The part of speech adopted as  member  of  the  phrase.
          For  this,  the same set of values are used as for part
          of speech.

     phrase type
          The value zero means `not the last word of the phrase'.
          A  non-zero  value  has  a double meaning. It indicates
          both `end of phrase' and the phrase type.   A  negative
          value  denotes  an apposition with a phrase type of the
          corresponding positive value.  The following values for
          phrase type are in use.

           1   VP     verbal phrase
           2   NP     nominal phrase
           3   PrNP   proper-noun phrase
           4   AdvP   adverbial phrase
           5   PP     prepositional phrase
           6   CP     conjunctive phrase
           7   PPrP   personal pronoun phrase
           8   DPrP   demonstrative pronoun phrase
           9   IPrP   interrogative pronoun phrase
          10   InjP   interjectional phrase
          11   NegP   negative phrase

NOTES
     The name PS file originally stems from the work on  Psalm  1
     in  the  early  days of the Werkgroep Informatica.  When the
     research shifted to phrases, the term was reassessed  as  to
     mean  `Phrase Structure' file.  Nowadays, however, this flag
     no longer covers its cargo as PS files are a data  base  for
     the complete morpho-syntactic analysis of a text.
