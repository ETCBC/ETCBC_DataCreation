NAME
     ps4 - morpho-syntactic analysis at clause level

SYNTAX
     The syntax of this file is an extension  to  the  syntax  of
     ps3(5), with the following modifications.

     ps4 =               catm { catm }.

     catm =              line { line } eoa.

     line =              label   <space>    lexical_data    space
                         morph_data    space    func_data   space
                         phrase_data catm_flag <newline>.

     eoa =               <eleven spaces> '*' <newline>.

     catm_flag =         integer.

DESCRIPTION
     ps4(5) is the format of the morpho-syntactic data base  out-
     put  by  syn04(1).  This type of file contains the result of
     the first step in the analysis at clause level, the division
     into  clause  atoms.   Clause atoms are the longest possible
     contiguous stretches of phrase atoms containing at most  one
     predication.   Apart  from adding `star lines' to signal the
     end of every clause atom, syn04(1) adds one  column  to  the
     format  of ps3(5), the column clause atom flag.  This column
     is a relict of an earlier phase and is no longer  used.   It
     was  intended to mark those clause atom divisions that could
     not be produced automatically.  Currently  in  this  column,
     the first word of every second and subsequent clause atom of
     the verse is marked with 99.  All other words have -1.

NOTES
     The name PS file originally stems from the work on  Psalm  1
     in  the  early  days of the Werkgroep Informatica.  When the
     research shifted to phrases, the term was reassessed  as  to
     mean  `Phrase Structure' file.  Nowadays, however, this flag
     no longer covers its cargo as PS files are a data  base  for
     the complete morpho-syntactic analysis of a text.
