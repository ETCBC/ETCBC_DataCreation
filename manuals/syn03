NAME
     syn03 - establish phrase atoms and update phrase set

SYNOPSIS
     syn03 [-l language]

DESCRIPTION
     Syn03 performs  the  third  stage  of  the  morpho-syntactic
     analysis  of  a  text, the determination of the phrase boun-
     daries.  It relies  on  a  file  called  synnr  produced  by
     syn02(1),  that  provides  the current stage in the analysis
     and the chapter of the text that  is  being  processed.   It
     insists  on the stage number being 2, as this indicates that
     syn02(1)  has  successfully  run  to  completion.   It  uses
     chapter   to   identify  its  input  files  chapter.ps2  and
     chapter.ct and to establish the names of  the  output  files
     chapter.npd,  chapter.pps  and chapter.ps3.  It further uses
     the files lexcond, morfcond and phrset as data base of valid
     phrase  patterns.   All  files need to reside in the current
     directory.  If any of the files lexcond, morfcond, or phrset
     is  missing, syn03 will use a copy of the standard file from
     the language directory.  When syn03  has  finished  success-
     fully,  it will update the stage number in synnr to 3, indi-
     cating that all phrase boundaries have been established.

     Syn03 processes a text one verse at a time.  For every verse
     it proposes a division into phrases, which the user is asked
     to confirm. If the user disagrees, he is asked to apply  the
     necessary  changes.  If  this  results  in the creation of a
     phrase pattern that is as yet unknown, it will be  added  to
     the program's phrase set (not the file).

     When displayed on the screen, the phrase  patterns  have  an
     identifier  which  consists  of  a number and a letter.  The
     number is the ordinal of the pattern within  the  collection
     and the letter indicates in which collection the pattern was
     found.

     d   Pattern from phd(5)
     j   Joined patterns
     s   Pattern from phrset(5)
     u   Pattern constructed by user during session

     A pattern marked by an asterisk  behind  the  phrase  number
     does not contain any lexical or morphological conditions.

     All the phrases that have been confirmed,  are  recorded  in
     the  file  chapter.npd.  The complete text data is stored in
     chapter.ps3, using the ps3(5) format.  At the end of a  ses-
     sion  the  phrase  set  together  with the newly constructed
     phrase patterns are written to a file called PHR.  A  survey
     of  the  phrase patterns used and their incidence is written

     to the file chapter.pps (phrase pattern statistics).

     After every verse the user is  offered  the  opportunity  to
     suspend the session. This results in a file chapter.npd that
     only partially covers the  text.   If  syn03  finds  a  file
     chapter.phd  or  chapter.npd when it is invoked, it will use
     the information from the bigger of these files to create the
     phrases. When this information is exhausted, it will turn to
     the user to proceed from this point on.

OPTIONS
     -l language
          Specifies which  versions  of  lexcond,  morfcond,  and
          phrset  are to be retrieved, if necessary.  The default
          language is Hebrew.

FILES
     lexcond   Lexical conditions.
     morfcond  Morphological conditions.
     phrset    Collection of approved  phrase  patterns  used  as
               input.
     synnr     Stage file.

NOTES
     In this description we have used `phrases' as a  short  hand
     for the more correct term `phrase atoms'.
