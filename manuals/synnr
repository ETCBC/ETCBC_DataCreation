NAME
     synnr - stage file

DESCRIPTION
     synnr is the file in  which  the  last  stage  of  the  text
     analysis  that  has been successfully completed is recorded.
     It consists of a single  line  with  a  number  and  a  name
     separated  by  white space.  The number indicates the stage,
     e.g. 1 means that syn01(1) has successfully run  to  comple-
     tion, 2 for syn02(1) and so on.  The name is the name of the
     text file the analysis started from and  serves  as  a  base
     name  for  the PS files produced by syn01(1) and its succes-
     sors.  The file synnr is created by syn00(1) with 0  as  the
     stage number and is updated by its successors.
