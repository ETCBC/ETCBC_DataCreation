DESCRIPTION
     The verblessList is a collection of valency patterns used by
     parseclauses(1).  It resides in the working directory and is
     updated with  new  patterns  approved  by  the  user  during
     interactive  sessions.   The standard initial version of the
     file is  /projects/grammar/lib/language/verblessList.   This
     file  contains  only well-attested patterns, which are those
     patterns within a section of  which  the  frequency  in  the
     corpus  exceeds  the average by at least one sample standard
     deviation.
