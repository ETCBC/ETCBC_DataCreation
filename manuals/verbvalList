NAME
     verbvalList - valency list for verbal clauses

SYNTAX
     file =              section + .

     section =           hline pattern + .

     hline =             `#lex  .Root .P123 .Modf .* .Adj4  .Adj5
                         .Adj6 .Parse' .

     pattern =           constituent {21} parsing .

     constituent =       marker label .

     parsing =           `<..>' | `<' [:alpha:] {2} `>' .

     marker =            `+' | `.' .

     label =             [:print:] {5} .

DESCRIPTION
     The verbvalList is a collection of valency patterns used  by
     parseclauses(1)  for the parsing of verbal clause atoms.  It
     resides in the working directory and  is  updated  with  new
     patterns  approved  by the user during interactive sessions.
     The   standard   initial   version   of    the    file    is
     /projects/grammar/lib/language/verbvalList.   This file con-
     tains only well-attested patterns, which are those  patterns
     within  a  section  of  which the frequency in the corpus is
     greater than one and exceeds the average by  more  than  one
     sample  standard  deviation.  A section consists of all pat-
     terns that share the same lexeme and verbal stem,  that  is,
     have identical values in the first two columns.
