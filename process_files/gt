NAME
     gt, gt_close, gt_lang, gt_lex, gt_open, gt_string, gt_vsid -
     read graphical text

SYNOPSIS
     #include <gt.h>

     int gt_close(gt_t *gt);

     char *gt_lang(const gt_t *gt);

     int gt_lex(gt_t *gt);

     gt_t *gt_open(const char *path);

     char *gt_string(const gt_t *gt);

     vsid_t *gt_vsid(const gt_t *gt);

DESCRIPTION
     gt_close(gt)
          Closes the  file  previously  opened  by  gt_open.   It
          returns 1 on success and 0 on error.

     gt_lang(gt)
          Returns a pointer to a static area that holds the  name
          of the current language.

     gt_lex(gt)
          Retrieves the next word from gt.  It returns a positive
          value on success, 0 on EOF and -1 on error.  On success
          the following bit masks can be used on the return value
          to determine what boundaries have been crossed.

          GT_WORD
               Always the case. A new word has been read from the
               file.

          GT_VERSE
               A verse boundary has been crossed.

          GT_LANGUAGE
               We entered a new language.

          GT_BOOK
               A new book has been entered.

          In the case of a syntactic error,  gt_lex  proceeds  by
          discarding  the  offending  input  and  making the best
          guess about the state from which to continue.

     gt_open(path)

BIBLICAL LANGUAGES                                          GT(3)



          Opens the file pointed to by path and returns a pointer
          for further reading with gt_lex.  If the file cannot be
          opened, it returns NULL.  System errors  like  insuffi-
          cient memory are signalled as exceptions.

     gt_string(gt)
          Returns the string representation of the last word read
          from gt.

     gt_vsid(gt)
          Returns a pointer to a vsid_t structure that  describes
          the current verse.

SEE ALSO
     at(3), gt(5), nblerr(3), vsid(3).

BUGS
     The maximum string length of a word is set  to  BUFSIZ.   An
     input token longer than BUFSIZ will cause a syntactic error.
