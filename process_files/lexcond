NAME
     lexcond - lexemes for the lexical conditions

DESCRIPTION
     The  file  lexcond  contains  the  list  of   lexemes   that
     correspond  with  the  lexical conditions used in phrset(5).
     The lexemes are listed one to a line. Each line consists  of
     nothing  but  the lexeme.  Lexical conditions are referenced
     through positive integers  that  correspond  with  the  line
     number  in  this  file.  A condition is met when the word in
     question has a lexeme that is identical to the one stated on
     the indicated line.

     In phrset(5) lexical conditions are listed with an offset of
     100  in order to discriminate them from morphological condi-
     tions. E.g. condition 105 in phrset(5)  stands  for  lexical
     condition number 5.
