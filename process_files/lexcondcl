NAME
     lexcondcl - lexemes for the lexical conditions

DESCRIPTION
     The  file  lexcondcl  contains  the  list  of  lexemes  that
     correspond with the lexical conditions indicated in clset(5)
     and used syn04(1).  The lexemes are listed one  to  a  line.
     Each  line consists of nothing but the lexeme.  Lexical con-
     ditions  are  referenced  through  positive  integers   that
     correspond  with  the line number in this file.  A condition
     is met when the word in question has a lexeme that is ident-
     ical to the one stated on the indicated line.

     In clset(5) lexical conditions are listed with an offset  of
     100  in order to discriminate them from morphological condi-
     tions.  For instance, condition 105 in clset(5)  stands  for
     lexical condition number 5.
