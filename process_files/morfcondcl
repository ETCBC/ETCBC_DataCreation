NAME
     morfcondcl  -  morphological  conditions  for   constructing
     clauses

SYNTAX
     file =              line { line }.

     line =              index function '=' value { value  }  EOI
                         comment <newline>.

     index =             <integer: the ordinal by which the  con-
                         dition is known>.

     function =          <integer  pointing  to  the  grammatical
                         function>.

     value =             <integer representing the value  of  the
                         word function>.

     EOI =               '99'.

     In the above syntax the white space  has  been  omitted  for
     reasons  of  clarity.   The  comment after the EOI marker is
     optional and is ignored.

DESCRIPTION
     The file morfcondcl  holds  the  `morphological'  conditions
     that  are  used  in  clset(5).   A  condition  is referenced
     through its ordinal and consists of a word function and  its
     approved values.  A word meets a condition if the designated
     function has one of the stated values.

     The index for `morphological' conditions must lie within the
     range  of  1 .. 100 as conditions with an index greater than
     100 are lexical conditions in clset(5).
