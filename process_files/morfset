NAME
     morfset - definition of morphemes

DESCRIPTION
     The first five lines of morfset define  the  morphemes  that
     will  be  recognised by syn01(1).  Each line defines one set
     of morphemes consisting of exactly N fields with a  constant
     width  of  exactly  W  positions.   The  numbers N and W may
     differ per file, but need to be constant throughout a single
     file.   Every field consists of the paradigmatic form of the
     morpheme together with the marker for  this  morpheme  type,
     padded  with spaces.  Fields that are not used are indicated
     by one or more dots  followed  by  the  required  amount  of
     spaces.

     Meaning of the lines.
          line 1 - preformative
          line 2 - root formation
          line 3 - verbal ending
          line 4 - nominal ending
          line 5 - pronominal suffix
     The field number (starting with 1 for the first field  on  a
     line)  of the field that defines a morpheme is the number by
     which the morpheme is designated in the ps1(5) file.

     Only the first five lines are significant, any further lines
     are considered comment.
