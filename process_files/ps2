NAME
     ps2 - morpho-syntactic analysis at word level

SYNTAX
     The syntax of this  file  is  identical  to  the  syntax  of
     ps1(5).

DESCRIPTION
     Ps2 is the format of the morpho-syntactic data  base  output
     by  syn02(1).   This type of file contains the result of the
     second analysis at word level, where  the  lexical  features
     are  being  assigned a value.  The lexical features are lex-
     eme, lexical set and part of speech.

     lexeme
          Has already been fully determined by syn01(1).

     lexical set
          The value attributed to  the  feature  lexical  set  is
          derived  from the information provided in lexset(5).  A
          positive value indicates the ordinal of the  lexeme  in
          the set of lexemes with this part of speech.  The value
          0 (absent) means that this lexeme is not  a  member  of
          any  lexical  set.  A negative value is the negative of
          the ordinal of the lexical subset of the set of lexemes
          with this part of speech this lexeme is a member of.

     part of speech
          The values of part of speech are 0 (article), 1 (verb),
          2 (noun), 3 (proper noun), 4 (adverb), 5 (preposition),
          6 (conjunction), 7 (personal pronoun), 8 (demonstrative
          pronoun), 9 (interrogative pronoun), 10 (interjection),
          11 (negative), 12 (interrogative) and 13 (adjective).

     For a number of lexemes (e.g. personal pronouns)  the  value
     of  person,  number  and  gender  has  been  set by syn02(5)
     according to the information found in lexset(5).

     The name PS file originally stems from the work om  Psalm  1
     in  the  early  days of the Werkgroep Informatica.  When the

     research shifted to phrases, the term was reassessed  as  to
     mean  `Phrase Structure' file.  Nowadays, however, this flag
     no longer covers its cargo as PS files are a data  base  for
     the complete morpho-syntactic analysis of a text.
