     genat - generate chapters of analysed text from *.an file

SYNOPSIS
     genat [-m] [-ffmt]  [-ttag]  [-uchapter]  -bbook  -llanguage
     [file..]

DESCRIPTION
     genat extracts all chapters from a morphological analysis in
     an(5)  format into separate files in at(5) format.  The name
     of each output file is constructed from the book  name  sup-
     plied   by  -bbook  and  the  chapter  number,  for  example
     BenSira12.at, or 2Kings13.at in case of  a  multipart  book.
     Files  in  the  current directory that are identical in name
     and contents with the chapter extracted are not overwritten.
     It  takes  its  input  from  the files given as arguments or
     standard input in the case of no arguments.

          Book name to be used in the output file names.

     -ffmt
          Format of the book name and chapter number in the  file
          name.  The default is "%s%02d".

     -llanguage
          Use language for the language directive in  the  output
          file.

     -m   Process a multipart book like Samuel or Kings.

     -ttag
          Abbreviation of the book name to be used in  the  verse
          label.  The default is the unabbreviated book name sup-
          plied by -bbook.

          Update  only  the  file  chapter.at.    If   the   file
