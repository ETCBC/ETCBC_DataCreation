NAME
     parseclauses - parse clauses

SYNOPSIS
     parseclauses

DESCRIPTION
     This parsing program matches previously parsed  clause  pat-
     terns with the clause atoms of a particular text.  It starts
     from a virtually empty set  of  clause  constituent  labels.
     During  the  parsing  process this set is filled with clause
     patterns made or accepted by the user.  This results in both
     an  update  of  the  linguistically  tagged Hebrew text and,
     ultimately, a collection of grammatical rules for the  pars-
     ing of Hebrew clauses.

  Parsing labels
     The collection of parsing labels which can  be  attached  to
     the  phrase function within the clause are defined in ct(5).
     The meaning and typical use of the  less  obvious  ones  are
     described below.

     Exst <eX>
          Used for nouns like JC/ that act as a copula.
          [JC <eX>] [JHWH <Su>] [B--MQWM H-ZH <PC>]

     ExsS <Xs>
          Used for nouns like JC/ that act as a copula and have a
          subject suffix attached to them.
          [JCKM <Xs>] [<FJM <PC>] [XSD W->MT <Ob>]

     NCop <NC>
          Used for nouns like >JN/ that act as a negated copula.
          [>JC <Su>] [>JN <NC>] [B-->RY <PC>]

     NCoS <Ns>
          Used for nouns like >JN/ that act as a  negated  copula
          and have a subject suffix attached to them.
          [>JNK <Ns>] [MCJB <PC>]
