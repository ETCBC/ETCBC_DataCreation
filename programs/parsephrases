NAME
     parsephrases - internal phrase parsing

SYNOPSIS
     parsephrases

DESCRIPTION
     parsephrases  is  a  semi-interactive  program   that   adds
     phrase-internal  parsing  to the phrase analysis of a ps3(5)
     file.  It uses an extended	phrase set nphrset to  parse  the
     phrases  in  its  input  file.  The result	is written in the
     form of a ps3.p(5)	file.	New  phrase  structure	templates
     created  by the user during the session are added to the set
     of	templates which	is read	from phrase.struc and written  to
     the file NewphraseStruc.

EXIT STATUS
     The exit status of	the program is undefined.
