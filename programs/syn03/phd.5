.SH DESCRIPTION
In the
.I phrase divisions file
(with the extension `phd') the decisions are recorded
that are made about the phrase divisions during a
.BR syn03 (1)
session.
For every verse processed there is one line in the file that
reflects the way this verse has been divided into phrases.
For every word in a phrase
.I state
and
.I phrase dependent part of speech
are stored, as are for every phrase
.I phrase type
and
.I determination.
.SH NOTES
In this description we have used `phrases' as a short hand
for the more correct term `phrase atoms'.
