.SH DESCRIPTION
Ps3 is the format of the morpho-syntactic data base output by
.BR syn03 (1).
This type of file contains the result of the analysis at phrase level,
where the phrase features are being assigned a value.
The phrase features are
.IR "phrase dependent part of speech" ,
.I phrase type
and
.I phrase determination.
.IP "phrase dependent part of speech"
The part of speech adopted as member of the phrase.
For this, the same set of values are used as for
.IR "part of speech" .
.IP "phrase type"
The value zero means `not the last word of the phrase'.
A non-zero value has a double meaning. It indicates both `end of phrase'
and the phrase type.
A negative value denotes an apposition with a phrase type of the
corresponding positive value.
The following values for
.I phrase type
are in use.

.SH NOTES
The name
.SM PS
file originally stems from the work on Psalm 1 in the
early days of the Werkgroep Informatica.
When the research shifted to phrases, the term was reassessed as to
mean `Phrase Structure' file.
Nowadays, however, this flag no longer covers its cargo as
.SM PS
files are a data base for the complete morpho-syntactic analysis of
a text.
