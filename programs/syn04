NAME
     syn04 - establish clause atom divisions

SYNOPSIS
     syn04

DESCRIPTION
     syn04 performs the  fourth  stage  of  the  morpho-syntactic
     analysis  of  a  text, the delimitation of the clause atoms.
     It relies on the synnr(5) stage file to find the  base  name
     of its input files.  It insists on the stage number being at
     least 3, as this indicates that  syn03(1)  has  successfully
     run to completion.

     Taking chapter as base name, its input files are chapter.ps3
     and   chapter.ct.    The  names  of  the  output  files  are
     chapter.div, chapter.ct4, and chapter.ps4.  It further  uses
     the  files  lexcondcl,  morfcondcl and clset as data base of
     valid clause atom patterns.  All files need to reside in the
     current directory.

     When syn04 has finished successfully,  it  will  update  the
     stage  number in synnr to 4, indicating that all clause atom
     boundaries have been established.

FILES
     addClSet  Updated version of clset(5).

     clset     Collection of approved clause atom  patterns  used
               as input.  See clset(5).

     lexcondcl Lexical conditions.

     morfcondcl
               Morphological conditions.

     partcldivis
               Clause atom divisions after an incomplete session.

     synnr     Stage file.

BUGS
     syn04 uses an inefficient algorithm to match the clause atom
     patterns, which causes it to run slowly when the pattern set
     grows large.
