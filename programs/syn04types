NAME
     syn04types - provide clause connections

SYNOPSIS
     syn04types

DESCRIPTION
     syn04types proposes and makes clause connections in  a  text
     in  consultation  with  the  user.   This  program  has been
     designed to replace the program syn05(1) for the parsing  of
     clause  connections  once  fully developed.  One goal of the
     development of syn04types is to  have  the  grammatical  and
     lexical  data  on  which  calculations  of  clause types and
     clause connections are based, program-external  as  much  as
     possible.   For  that reason the program needs special input
     files with these grammatical data.   During  a  session  the
     files with these data will be updated, recording the choices
     made by the user.

     syn04types reads a ps4(5) file  or  (if  one  wants  to  use
     existing  data of clause connections) a ps5(5) file. This is
     decided by the contents  of  the  file  synnr(5).   To  have
     access to a file with surface-text data, the program reads a
     ct4(5) file (a surface-text  file  with  clause  constituent
     labels).   If a ct4(5) file does not exist, the program will
     read the corresponding lay.asc file,  made  by  syn04lay(1),
     after completion of clause divisions by syn04(1).

     If syn04types has been used before to create clause  connec-
     tions  of  a  particular text, a usertab(5) file exists with
     instructions for the clause types and clause tabs entered by
     the  user. If the program is applied to the same text again,
     it will use the instructions present in this usertab.

     The output of the program is a CTT(5)  file  (comparable  to
     the  ctt(5)  file  made  by  the actual version of syn05(1).
     This file presents the surface format of the text  with  the
     tabs  added  to  it  and  some  data  from  the  grammatical
     analysis: verbal tense, blocks of direct speech in a  narra-
     tive.

     A CTT.rev file can be made on request.  It is an  adaptation
     of the CTT file for ctt2rtf(1).

     The tabs proposed by the user are stored in  the  usertab(5)
     file.

     For the time being the program also stores the tabs  in  the
     format  of  the inn(5) file as used by syn05(1).  syn04types
     is also capable of reading the existing ps5 file  types  and
     composing  a  usertab file from it, so that the existing ps5
     data produced by syn05, can be used.

     Furthermore the program produces a typ.asc file, which is  a
     printout of the internal array with clause level information
     used to propose clause  connections.  The  file  presents  a
     description of all lines (clause atoms) of the text in terms
     of phrases and phrase types. The phrases are listed  accord-
     ing  to  the  position  they  have in a more abstract model:
     clause opening elements, preverbal  phrases,  adjectival  or
     verbal predicate, postverbal phrases.

     As a result of the clause connections made, syn04types  also
     produces  a  px(5) file. Its format equals the format of the
     ps5 files made by syn05 en syn05codes(1).  syn04types calcu-
     lates  the  three  digit codes for clause connections in the
     same way as syn05codes did. The px file can be read  by  the
     program  struc(1)  to reformat it into a textual schema (see
     sch(5)).

     The file ClFreqTot contains the frequencies  of  the  clause
     connections  of  all  texts  analysed  so  far.  The file is
     updated by addition of the statistics of the clause  connec-
     tions of the text being analysed in a particular session.

COMMANDS
     In interactive mode, the program accepts the following char-
     acter  commands, which can be combined into a single string.
     Within such a string,  commands  have  priority  over  their
     predecessors.

     `#'      New paragraph
     `+'      Increase indentation
     `-'      Decrease indentation
     `/'      Parallel connection
     `0..9'   Clause atom number
     `='      Same indentation
     `B'      Go back
     `N'      No relation; start new paragraph
     `R'      Clause constituent relation
     `S'      Stop session
     `T'      Absolute tab
     `U'      Undo
     `\'      Downward connection
     `^'      Dependent connection
     `c'      Casus pendens
     `d'      Defective clause atom
     `e'      Embedded clause atom
     `l'      Ellipsis
     `m'      Macrosyntactic sign
     `q'      Start of direct speech paragraph
     `r'      (Not implemented)
     `v'      Vocative clause atom

          This file is no longer used by the program.  The  start
          of  a direct speech section is now detected with a dif-
          ferent, probabilistic, algorithm.   The  file  contains
          sets of clause connection labels from ArgumentsList, to
          determine the start of a direct speech section.

BUGS
     The user should be aware of  the  fact  that  syn04types  is
     still  experimental  in  many  respects.  Yet the program is
     stable enough for the production of clause connections.

     The following lexemes are internal to the program:   >W  or,
     >JN/  is  not,  >M if, >MR[ to say, >NXNW we, >NJ I, >NKJ I,
     >CR which, >T object marker, >T= you, >TH you, >TM you,  >TN
