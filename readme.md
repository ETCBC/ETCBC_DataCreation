[ETCBC Data Creation](http://www.etcbc.nl/datacreation)

This repository contains source code for the syntactic processing programs used to produce the [BHSA](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa) data under `/programs`.

This repository also contains zipped data files for the book of Genesis in the `/example_data`. To access those files, unzip using `gunzip [file]` from command line.


## Analyzed Texts for BHS

The analyzed files produced by the pipeline for BHS can be viewed in [https://github.com/ETCBC/source](https://github.com/ETCBC/source). These files are converted to Text-Fabric format in the BHSA ([https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa)) for easy processing and analysis in [Text-Fabric](https://annotation.github.io/text-fabric/).
